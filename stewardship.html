    <h2>Global Carbon Vault Surpasses 1 Trillion Tons Sequestered</h2>
    <p>In a landmark moment for planetary restoration, the UN-backed Global Carbon Vault announced it has surpassed 1 trillion tons of atmospheric carbon sequestered, nearly offsetting the industrial emissions of the 20th and 21st centuries. Powered by continent-scale direct air capture arrays and next-gen basalt mineralization techniques, the Vault operates across five mega-habitats including the Sahara, Australian Outback, and Martian lowlands. “This marks the beginning of Earth’s rewilding century,” said Ava N’Doye, Secretary-General of the Earth System Stewardship Agency.</p>

      <h2>Clean Energy Dividend Reaches Every Human on Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Following the universal adoption of orbital solar infrastructure, 
        the Clean Energy Dividend program has delivered its 50th annual payment 
        to all recognized Earth citizens. With energy costs near zero, global 
        inequality continues to shrink.

      <h2>Where the Buffalo Roam once again</h2>
      <p>
        The successful reintroduction of bison to the Great Plains marks a historic milestone 
        in North America’s ecological restoration efforts. Once on the brink of extinction, 
        these majestic animals now roam freely across vast grasslands, playing a vital role 
        in restoring the natural balance of the ecosystem.

        The small herds that survived throughout the 20th and 21st centuries in places like 
        Great Plains National Park and Caprock Canyons State Park are now the ancestors of 
        expansive herds stretching across the plains. These thriving populations help maintain 
        healthy grasslands through their grazing patterns.

        To protect these iconic creatures and ensure sustainable growth, new hunting regulations 
        have been established. Beyond reviving bison populations, this restoration effort has 
        also revitalized local ecosystems and economies, while offering alternatives to the 
        environmental challenges posed by factory farming.
