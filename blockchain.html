      <h2>Ethereum’s Quantum Leap: The L0 Revolution (2053)</h2>
      <p>
        In 2053, Ethereum underwent a landmark transformation that reshaped blockchain forever. 
        The base consensus layer was shifted from the original L1 network to a new L0 quantum 
        layer, harnessing the power of early commercial quantum computers. This upgrade allowed 
        near-instantaneous transaction finality, quantum-secured cryptography, and unparalleled 
        scalability.

        Despite the leap to quantum computing, the network maintained its decentralized 
        ethos — validators (or “stakers”) still participated in a consensus protocol designed 
        to resist quantum attacks and preserve trustlessness. The move sparked a wave of 
        innovation, from quantum-resistant smart contracts to hybrid classical-quantum 
        decentralized apps, laying the foundation for the quantum-era web3.

        Looking back from 2331, this transition is seen as the moment when blockchain evolved 
        from a classical cryptographic curiosity to the backbone of interstellar digital society.
